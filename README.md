# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes various features such as **age, gender, class, and family size**, and the main model used is a **Random Forest Classifier** optimized with GridSearchCV.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset comes from the famous **Titanic dataset** available on Kaggle.  
- `train.csv` → Used for training the model  
- `test.csv` → Used for predictions  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Model training with **Random Forest**  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**  
✅ Performance evaluation using **confusion matrix & classification report**
